or individuals) that help us to provide, analyze and improve our Services.\nWhile 23andMe directly conducts the majority of data processing activities required to provide our Services to you, we engage some third party service providers to assist in supporting our Services, including in the following areas:\nOrder fulfillment and shipping.\nOur payment processor processes certain Registration Information, such as your billing address and credit card information, as necessary to enable you to purchase a 23andMe kit from the 23andMe.com online store.\nOur distribution centers ship your kit(s) to you, and in some cases help return your kit safely to our third party laboratory so your sample can be processed.\nOur CLIA-certified genotyping lab.\nTo use our genetic testing services, you must purchase, or receive as a gift, a 23andMe Personal Genetic Service testing kit, and ship your saliva sample to our third party laboratory.\nOnce delivered, receiving personnel at the laboratory remove and discard kit packaging, which in some cases may contain \"sender information\" (eg, name, address), before testing personnel receive the samples for processing.\nReceiving personnel do not perform testing, and testing personnel handle saliva samples that are only identified by a unique barcode.\nWhen the laboratory has completed their analysis, they securely send the resulting Genetic Information to us identified by your unique barcode.\nDuring kit registration, you are asked to review our Consent Document for Sample Storage and Additional Genetic Analyses.\nUnless you consent to Biobanking and additional analyses, your saliva sample and DNA are destroyed after the laboratory completes its work, subject to the laboratory's legal and regulatory requirements.\nShould you wish to update your sample storage preference to discard a stored sample, you can do so within your Account Settings once your sample has completed processing.\n\n---\n\n(Account Deletion) our contracted genotyping laboratory will retain certain information as necessary to comply with applicable regulatory and legal obligations.\n\n---\n\nOur

providers assist with intrusion detection and prevention measures to stop any potential attacks against our networks.\nWe have these third party experts perform regular penetration tests and periodically audit 23andMes security controls.\n\n---\n\nWhen you use our Services, including our website or mobile app(s), our third party service providers may collect Web-Behavior Information about your visit, such as the links you clicked on, the duration of your visit, and the URLs you visited.\nThis information can help us improve site navigability and assess our Marketing campaigns.\n\n---\n\n\"Targeted advertising\" service providers We permit third party advertising networks and providers to collect Web-Behavior Information regarding the use of our Services to help us to deliver targeted online advertisements (\"ads\") to you.\nThey use cookies and similar technologies, to gather information about your browser's or device's visits and usage patterns on our Services and on other websites over time, which helps to better personalize ads to match your interests, and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.\n\n---\n\nAggregate information We may share Aggregate Information, which is information that has been stripped of your name and contact information and combined with information of others so that you cannot reasonably be identified as an individual, with third parties.\nThis Information is different from \"Individual-level\" information and is not Personal Information because it does not identify any particular individual or disclose any particular individuals data.\nFor example, Aggregate Information may include a statement that \"30% of our female users share a particular genetic trait,\" without providing any data or testing results specific to any individual user.\nIn contrast, Individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information consists of data about a single individual's genotypes, diseases or other traits/characteristics information and could reveal whether a specific user has a particular genetic trait, or consist of all of the Genetic Information about that user.\n23andMe will ask for your consent to share Individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information with any third party, other than our service providers as necessary for us to provide the Services to you.\nInformation we share with commonly owned entities We may share some or all of your Personal Information with other companies under common ownership or control of 23andMe, which may include our subsidiaries, our corporate parent, or any other subsidiaries owned by our corporate parent in order to provide you better service and improve user experience.\nGenerally, sharing such information is

others if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal or regulatory process (such as a judicial
