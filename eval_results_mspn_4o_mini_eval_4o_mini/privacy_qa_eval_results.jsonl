conducted on behalf of, or in collaboration with third parties, such as non-profit foundations, academic institutions or pharmaceutical companies.\n23andMe Research may study a specific group or population, identify potential areas or targets for therapeutics development, conduct or support the development of drugs, diagnostics or devices to diagnose, predict or treat medical or other health conditions, work with public, private and/or non-profit entities on genetic research initiatives, or otherwise create, commercialize, and apply this new knowledge to improve health care.\n23andMe Research uses Aggregate and/or Individual-level Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information as specified in the appropriate Consent Document(s), as explained in greater detail below.\n\n---\n\nYour Genetic Information and/or Self-Reported Information will be used for research purposes, but it will be de-identified and will not be linked to your Registration Information.\n\n---\n\nIf you have completed the Individual Level Data Sharing Consent, or additional consent agreement, in addition to the uses above under the Main Consent Document, 23andMe may share De-identified Individual-level Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information with select third party research collaborators for 23andMe partners for Research purposes.\n\n---\n\nIf you choose not to complete a Consent Document or any additional agreement with 23andMe, your Personal Information will not be used for 23andMe Research.\nHowever, your Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information may still be used by us and shared with our third party service providers to as outlined in this Privacy Statement.\n\n---\n\nWe share the information described above in Section 2 with our third party service providers, as necessary for them to provide their services to us and help us perform our contract with you.\nService providers are third parties (other companies or individuals) that help us to provide, analyze and improve our Services.\nWhile 23andMe directly conducts the majority of data processing activities required to provide our Services to you, we engage some third party service providers to assist in supporting our Services, including in the following areas:\nOrder fulfillment and shipping.\nOur payment processor processes certain Registration Information, such as your billing address and credit card information, as necessary to enable you to purchase a 23andMe kit from the 23andMe.com online store.\nOur distribution centers ship your kit(s) to you, and in some cases help return your kit safely to our third party laboratory so your sample can be processed.\nOur CLIA-certified genotyping lab.\nTo use our genetic testing services, you must purchase, or receive as a gift, a 23andMe Personal Genetic Service testing kit, and ship your saliva sample to our third party laboratory.\nOnce delivered, receiving personnel at the laboratory remove and discard kit packaging, which in some cases may contain \"sender information\" (eg, name, address), before testing personnel receive the samples for processing.\nReceiving personnel do not perform testing, and testing personnel handle saliva samples that are only identified by a unique barcode.\nWhen the laboratory has completed their analysis, they securely send the resulting Genetic Information to us identified by your unique barcode.\nDuring kit registration, you are asked to review our Consent Document for Sample Storage and Additional Genetic Analyses.\nUnless you consent to Biobanking and additional analyses, your saliva sample and DNA are destroyed after the laboratory completes its work, subject to the laboratory's legal and regulatory requirements.\nShould you wish to update your sample storage preference to discard a stored sample, you can do so within your Account Settings once your sample has completed processing.\n\n---\n\n(Account Deletion) our contracted genotyping laboratory will retain certain information as necessary to comply with applicable regulatory and legal obligations.\n\n---\n\nOur Customer Care team uses a number of tools to help organize and manage the requests we receive.\n\n---\n\nOur cloud storage providers provide secure storage for information in 23andMe databases, ensure that our infrastructure can support continued use of our Services by 23andMe customers, and protect data in the event of a natural disaster or other disruption to the Service.\nOur IT and security providers assist with intrusion detection and prevention measures to stop any potential attacks against our networks.\nWe have these third party experts perform regular penetration tests and periodically audit 23andMes security controls.\n\n---\n\nWhen you use our Services, including our website or mobile app(s), our third party service providers may collect Web-Behavior Information about your visit, such as the links you clicked on, the duration of your visit, and the URLs you visited.\nThis information can help us improve site navigability and assess our Marketing campaigns.\n\n---\n\n\"Targeted advertising\" service providers We permit third party advertising networks and providers to collect Web-Behavior Information regarding the use of our Services to help us to deliver targeted online advertisements (\"ads\") to you.\nThey use cookies and similar technologies, to gather information about your browser's or device's visits and usage patterns on our Services and on other websites over time, which helps to better personalize ads to match your interests, and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.\n\n---\n\nAggregate information We may share Aggregate Information, which is information that has been stripped of your name and contact information and combined with information of others so that you cannot reasonably be identified as an individual, with third parties.\nThis Information is different from \"Individual-level\" information and is not Personal Information because it does not identify any particular individual or disclose any particular individuals data.\nFor example, Aggregate Information may include a statement that \"30% of our female users share a particular genetic trait,\" without providing any data or testing results specific to any individual user.\nIn contrast, Individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information consists of data about a single individual's genotypes, diseases or other traits/characteristics information and could reveal whether a specific user has a particular genetic trait, or consist of all of the Genetic Information about that user.\n23andMe will ask for your consent to share Individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information with any third party, other than our service providers as necessary for us to provide the Services to you.\nInformation we share with commonly owned entities We may share some or all of your Personal Information with other companies under common ownership or control of 23andMe, which may include our subsidiaries, our corporate parent, or any other subsidiaries owned by our corporate parent in order to provide you better service and improve user experience.\nGenerally, sharing such information is necessary for us to perform on our contract with you.\nWe may provide additional notice and ask for your prior consent if we wish to share your Personal Information with our commonly owned entities in a materially different way than discussed in this Privacy Statement.\nAs required by law Under certain circumstances your Personal Information may be subject to processing pursuant to laws, regulations, judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.\nFor example, we may be required to disclose Personal Information in coordination with regulatory authorities in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\n23andMe will preserve and disclose any and all information to law enforcement agencies or others if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal or regulatory process (such as a judicial proceeding, court order, or government inquiry) or obligations that 23andMe may owe pursuant to ethical and other professional rules, laws, and regulations; (b) enforce the 23andMe Terms of Service

you post on Communities, the admin of the Community has the ability to allow everybody to access it, but you can always actively delete messages you posted. \n We cannot prevent or control further use of this information so please make sure you only post information that youre happy to be seen publicly. \n We may also further use such public information you share, for various reasons, such as improving our service and providing you with relevant content, and analyzing trends. \n You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. \n Please refer to those third-party sites privacy policies and terms of use to learn more about their privacy practices, as we do not control these. \n At this stage, whatever you share publicly is available to the entire Viber community. \n If you wish to remove a certain piece of content you have shared in the past, you can do that by deleting that content. \n It will be removed from our services but may remain on local devices of some users (assuming they have chosen to save it). \n We want you to have control over how you communicate. \n That is why, for example, we allow you to delete messages even after they have been sent (it will be deleted for you, your friend and our service). \n How cool is that? \n You can also control your privacy settings within the App to change the visibility of your online status or prevent other users from knowing which Viberapps and games you are using. \n You can disable the seen notification so that other users do not know whether youve read a message yet. \n You can choose not to share your photo, opt not to receive location-based messages along with many other additional options, which are available within the app. \n You can also make additional choices on your phones settings by changing our apps permissions such as location sharing, access to contact list and more. \n Every now and then, Viber may send you updates about administration and operation of the Service (for example, about your transactions, policy changes, technical issues, etc). \n"}, "retrieved_citations": [{}], "llm_eval_score": 6, "llm_eval_explanation": "The Generated

Transfers below for more information. \n Some of our Services allow you to share information with others on a public basis. \n If you post information on a public feature of our Services or through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, do not forget this information is public on our Services and, depending upon your privacy settings, may also become public on the Internet. \n When you post on Communities, the admin of the Community has the ability to allow everybody to access it, but you can always actively delete messages you posted. \n We cannot prevent or control further use of this information so please make sure you only post information that youre happy to be seen publicly. \n We may also further use such public information you share, for various reasons, such as improving our service and providing you with relevant content, and analyzing trends. \n You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. \n Please refer to those third-party sites privacy policies and terms of use to learn more about their privacy practices, as we do not control these. \n At this stage, whatever you share publicly is available to the entire Viber community. \n If you wish to remove a certain piece of content you have shared in the past, you can do that by deleting that content. \n It will be removed from our services but may remain on local devices of some users (assuming they have chosen to save it). \n We want you to have control over how you communicate. \n That is why, for example, we allow you to delete messages even after they have been sent (it will be deleted for you, your friend and our service). \n How cool is that? \n You can also control your privacy settings within the App to change the visibility of your online status or prevent other users from knowing which Viberapps and games you are using. \n You can disable the seen notification so that other users do not know whether youve read a message yet. \n You can choose not to share your photo, opt not to receive location-based messages along with many other additional options, which are available within the app. \n You can also make additional choices on your phones settings by changing our apps permissions such as location sharing, access to contact list and more. \n Every now and then, Viber may send you updates about administration and operation of the Service (for example, about your transactions, policy changes, technical issues, etc). \n"}, "retrieved_citations": [{}], "llm_eval_score": 4, "llm_eval_explanation": "The generated
